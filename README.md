Client library for AQI BLE peripheral: https://github.com/Raizlabs/air_quality_bluetooth_le

BLE Constants: 

```python
AQI_PM_SRVC = '22AF619F-4A1B-4BCB-B481-5B13BFE86E94'
PM_2_5_CHRC = '2A6E'
PM_10_CHRC = '2A6F'
PM_2_5_FMT_DSCP = '2904'
PM_10_FMT_DSCP = '2905'
```

The characteristics support both read and notify, and return little endian IEEE 754 32-bit float values representing PM 2.5 and PM10 concentrations in units of Âµg/m3. 

## Example
